## Profiling

Profilers help you find out where the program is spending its time
and pinpoint places where optimising it makes sense.
In this lesson we will use ARM Performance Reports, which is part of the 
ARM Forge suite of programs, but many other profilers exist.
ARM Forge is specifically for MPI applications; it will give you
information on communication efficiency and bottlenecks.

ARM Forge (formerly known as Allinea Forge) is developed by the semiconductor 
and software design company ARM
For more information check the [project website](https://www.arm.com/products/development-tools/server-and-hpc/forge). Instructions for how to use ARM Forge at 
PDC can be found [on the support pages](https://www.pdc.kth.se/software/software/allinea-forge/index_general.html).

It is used together with the [Score-P](https://www.vi-hps.org/projects/score-p/) utility, the Cube library
and the Cube viewer.
Since it is open source, you can install it in your home directory on any HPC cluster
that does not already have it.
The process is as described in [setup](setup), but you need to add
`--prefix=$HOME/scalasca/` to the `./configure` command to install in
your home folder.

### Summary profile

It is advisable to create a short version of you program, limiting the
runtime to a few minutes.
You may be able to reduce the problem size or required precision,
as long as this does not change the algorithm itself.
We will use the Poisson solver from the previous lesson as an example.
The example program used here (and at the end of the previous section)
is
[here](../code/poisson/poisson_profiling.c){: .show-c}
[here](../code/poisson/poisson_profiling.F08){: .show-fortran}.

Later we will see how we can limit the scope of the profiler, but first
we need to run a summary of the whole program.
Start by recompiling the application, replacing `mpicc` with the version
provided by the Score-P utility.

Assuming the final version is saved into `poisson.c` it is compiled with:
{: .show-c}
~~~
scorep mpicc -o poisson poisson.c
~~~
{: .source .language-bash .show-c}

Assuming the final version is saved into `poisson.F08` it is compiled with:
{: .show-fortran}
~~~
scorep mpifort -o poisson poisson.F08
~~~
{: .source .language-bash .show-fortran}

This will produce an instrumented binary.
When you execute it, it will track function calls and the time spent in each
function.

Next, run the new executable using Scalasca to analyse the data gathered:
~~~
scalasca -analyze mpirun -n 2 poisson
~~~
{: .source .language-bash}

Finally, you can examine the results in the GUI:
~~~
scalasca -examine scorep_poisson_2_sum
~~~
{: .source .language-bash}

This will open cubeGUI.
If you are running the GUI on a cluster over a normal internet connection,
it may be slow and unresponsive.
It's usually faster to copy the data folder (here `scorep_poisson_2_sum`)
to your computer and run the GUI there.

![A picture of the cube GUI]({{ page.root }}{% link fig/cube.png %})

The GUI has three panels: a metric view, a function view and a system view.
In the metric view you can pick a metric to be displayed.
You can dig into the details of some of the metrics in a tree view.
The second panels shows functions either as a call tree, displaying
which functions have called what, or as a flat view.
It also displays the metric you have chosen on a function level.
The system view displays data on the chosen function on a deeper level.

Right clicking on the view and choosing "Info" replaces the system view with an info view.
This gives information on the chosen metric.

If you are running on a cluster you may wish to use the command line instead.
To supress the GUI, use the `-s` parameter:
~~~
scalasca -examine -s scorep_poisson_2_sum
cat scorep_poisson_2_sum/scorep.score
~~~
{: .source .language-bash}
The command line version will produce output that looks something like this:
~~~
Estimated aggregate size of event trace:                   501kB
Estimated requirements for largest trace buffer (max_buf): 251kB
Estimated memory requirements (SCOREP_TOTAL_MEMORY):       4097kB
(hint: When tracing set SCOREP_TOTAL_MEMORY=4097kB to avoid intermediate flushes
 or reduce requirements using USR regions filters.)

{: .output}

Either way we find that in our case, the program is waiting for MPI
communication for 13% of the total runtime.
This is not great for only two cores, so we would like to know if we can do better.
87% of the time is spent in `poisson_step`.
This is not counting the time spent in functions called by poisson step.
This essentially means that 87% of the time is spent in actual computation.

If you are working on a terminal and prefer not to use the GUI, Cube
can print most of the information for you
For example the following will print out the time spent in each function:
~~~
cube_stat -t 20 -p scorep_poisson_2_sum/profile.cubex
~~~
{: .source .language-bash}
This outputs
~~~

~~~
{: .output}

The INCL(main) includes function calls inside the main function, while
EXCL(main) counts only the time spent in the main function itself.

This tells us clearly that `poisson_step` is the most important function
to optimise.

You can also print a call tree using:
~~~
cube_calltree -m time scorep_poisson_2_sum/summary.cubex
~~~
{: .source .language-bash}
This will print a tree view of function calls with timings:
~~~

### Filtering

You can probably see that in a larger program the call tree would be large
and hard to manage.
The graphical interface makes this a bit easier, but the real solution is filtering.

Filtering can be used to turn off measurements in less important parts of
the code or to restrict measurements to the most interesting parts
of the code.
The filter needs to be saved as a file.
The following will filter out everything except `poisson_step`, effectively
restricting the measurements to this function:
~~~
SCOREP_REGION_NAMES_BEGIN
  EXCLUDE
    *
  INCLUDE
    poisson_step
SCOREP_REGION_NAMES_END
~~~
{: .source}

Save this to a file called `poisson.filter` and run:
~~~
scorep-score -f poisson.filter -r scorep_poisson_2_sum/profile.cubex
~~~
{: .source .language-bash}

The output is similar to before, but it now includes a filter column:
~~~
Estimated aggregate size of event trace:                   501kB
Estimated requirements for largest trace buffer (max_buf): 251kB
Estimated memory requirements (SCOREP_TOTAL_MEMORY):       4097kB
(hint: When tracing set SCOREP_TOTAL_MEMORY=4097kB to avoid intermediate flushes
 or reduce requirements using USR regions filters.)

~~~
{: .output}
The `+` and `-` sign denote what is filtered out and what is not.
The `*` character denotes a region that is partially filtered.
In this case, only the main function is filtered out. Unfortunately we cannot
remove the MPI_Init function. Normally we would run for longer and it would
not matter.

Once you are happy with the filter, it can then be passed to Score-P with the
`SCOREP_FILTERING_FILE` environment variable:
~~~
export SCOREP_FILTERING_FILE=poisson.filter
scorep mpicc -o poisson poisson.c
~~~
{: .source .language-bash .show-c}
~~~
export SCOREP_FILTERING_FILE=poisson.filter
scorep mpifort -o poisson poisson.F08
~~~
{: .source .language-bash .show-fortran}
Score-P will only instrument and measure the parts of the program not filtered out.
This make profiling faster and the results easier to analyse.

### Trace Analysis

Let's now run the application with the full trace using the `-t` flag:
~~~
scalasca -analyze -t mpirun -n 2 poisson
~~~
{: .source .language-bash}
And examine the results written to the `scorep_poisson_2_trace` directory:
~~~
scalasca -examine scorep_poisson_2_trace
~~~
{: .source .language-bash}

There are some new measurements on the left column.
Notably you will find a a measure of `MPI_Wait` states, how long the ranks spend
waiting for data.
In addition, you will see the number of MPI communications, and the time spent synchronising
ranks.

>## User defined regions

## Optimisation Workflow

The general workflow for optimising a code, wether parallel or serial
is as follows:
1. Profile.
2. Optimise.
3. Test correctness.
4. Measure efficiency.
5. Goto: 1.


> ## Iterative Improvement
>
> In the Poisson code,
> try changing the location of the calls to `MPI_Send`. How does this affect performance?
