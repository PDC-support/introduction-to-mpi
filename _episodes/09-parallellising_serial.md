## Going from Serial to Parallel

The examples used in the previous sections were perhaps not the most realistic.
In this section we will look at a more complete code and take it from serial to
parallel in a couple of steps.

The exercises and solutions are based on a code that solves the Poisson's equation using an iterative method.
In this case the equation describes how heat diffuses in a metal stick.
In the simulation the stick is split into small sections with a constant
temperature.
At one end the amount of heat is set to 10 and at the other to 0.
The code applies steps that bring each point closer to a solution
untill it reaches an equilibrium.

### Parallel Regions

The first step is to identify parts of the code that
can be written in parallel.
Go through the algorithm and decide for each region if the data can be partitioned for parallel execution,
or if certain tasks can be separated and run in parallel.

Can you find large or time consuming serial regions?
The sum of the serial regions gives the minimum amount of time it will take to run the program.
If the serial parts are a significant part of the algorithm, it may not be possible to write an efficient parallel version.
Can you replace the serial parts with a different, more parallel algorithm?


> ## Parallel Regions
>
> Identify any parallel and serial regions in the code.

>
>> ## Solution
>>
>> The loops over space can be run in parallel.
>> There are parallisable loops in:
>> * the setup, when initialising the fields.
>> * the calculation of the time step, `unew`.
>> * the difference, `unorm`.
>> * overwriting the field `u`.
>> * writing the files could be done in parallel.
>>
>> The best strategy would seem to be parallelising the loops.
>> This will lead to a domain decomposed implementation with the
>> elements of the fields `u` and `rho` divided across the ranks.

### Communication Patterns

If you decide it's worth your time to try to parallelise the problem,
the next step is to decide how the ranks will share the tasks or the data.
This should be done for each region separately, but taking into account the time it would take to reorganise the data if you decide to change the pattern between regions.

The parallelisation strategy is often based on the
underlying problem the algorithm is dealing with.
For example, in materials science it makes sense
to decompose the data into domains by splitting the
physical volume of the material.

Most programs will use the same pattern in every region.
There is a cost to reorganising data, mostly having to do with communicating large blocks between ranks.
This is really only a problem if done in a tight loop, many times per second.

> ## Communications Patterns
>
> How would you divide the data between the ranks?
> When does each rank need data from other ranks?
> Which ranks need data from which other ranks?
>
>> ## Solution
>>
>> Only one of the loops requires data from the other ranks,
>> and these are only nearest neighbours.
>>
>> Parallelising the loops would actually be the same thing as splitting the physical volume.
>> Each iteration of the loop accesses one element
>> in the `rho` and `uner` fields and four elements in
>> the `u` field.
>> The `u` field needs to be communicated if the value
>> is stored on a different rank.
>>
>> There is also a global reduction for calculating `unorm`.
>> Every node needs to know the result.

### Set Up Tests

Write a set of tests for the function you are planning to edit.
The tests should be sufficient to make sure each function performs correctly
in any situation when all tests pass.
You should test all combinations of different types of parameters and preferably use random input.
Here the habit of modular programming is very useful. When the functions are small and have a small amount of possible input types, they are easy to test.

> ## Automated Testing
>
> There are automated unit testing frameworks for almost any programming language.
> Automated testing greatly simplifies the workflow of running your tests and
> verifying that the entire program is correct.
> The program here is still relatively simple, we are testing a single function,
> so writing a main function with a test case is enough.

### Write a Parallel Function Thinking About a Single Rank

In the message passing framework, all ranks execute the same code.
When writing a parallel code with MPI, you should think of a single rank.
What does this rank need to to and what information does it need to do it?

Communicate data in the simplest possible way
just after it's created or just before it's needed.
Use blocking or non-blocking communication, whichever you feel is simpler.
If you use non-blocking functions, call wait immediately.

The point is to write a simple code that works correctly.
You can optimise later.

> ## Parallel Execution
>
> First, just implement a single step.
> Write a program that performs the iterations from
> `j=rank*(GRIDSIZE/n_ranks)` to `j=(rank+1)*(GRIDSIZE/n_ranks)`.
> For this, you should not need to communicate the field `u`.
> You will need a reduction.
>
> After this step the first test should succeed and the second test
> should fail.

### Optimise

Now it's time to think about optimising the code.
Try it with a different numbers of ranks, up to
the maximum number you expect to use.
In the next lesson we will talk about a parallel profiler that can produce
useful information for this.

It's also good to check the speed with just one rank.
In most cases it can be made as fast as a serial code
using the same algorithm.

When making changes to improve performance, keep running the test suite.
There is no reason to write a program that is fast but produces wrong
results.
