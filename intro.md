## Welcome and practical aspects

- Come on in! Sit down next to someone, it can be useful to discuss with 
  someone during the exercises.
- You will have a choice between running exercises on your laptop or on 
  the Tegner cluster at PDC (tegner.pdc.kth.se)
- **Any installation issues? Please talk to us.**
- **Need any help logging in to PDC?**
- Want to check that your MPI installation in your laptop is working?
  Open terminal and type `mpirun --version`
- Check the [installation instructions](setup) for a guide to install MPI 
  on your laptop.
- We want everybody to be comfortable, please point out problems.
- We will have both longer breaks and shorter breaks between lessons parts.
- Presentation of instructors and helpers.

#### For online workshops

- Instructor gives a [tour of Zoom](https://github.com/coderefinery/manuals/blob/master/zoom-mechanics.md).
- Announce that Zoom chat can be used for questions but that the content will be deleted afterwards.
- We will use a hackmd for questions/notes/links that we want to keep.
- We will neither record the session, nor archive the chat.
- Instructor gives a tour of hackmd which contains a list of participants' initials.
- Ice-breaker: ask participants to use their real name on Zoom,
  roll-call for participants to write their name in the hackmd, their
  experience with HPC, instructor writes the first line to
  show what we expect here and also explains how hackpads work.


### About PDC

- Founded in 1990 to provide HPC computing and storage resources,
  together with advanced system and application support, to Swedish
  academic researchers.  
- Main HPC system at PDC is 
  [Beskow](https://www.pdc.kth.se/hpc-services/computing-systems), 
  a Cray XC40 with a peak performance of nearly 2.5 petaflops
- We also have a smaller heterogeneous cluster called 
  [Tegner](https://www.pdc.kth.se/hpc-services/computing-systems/tegner-1.737437)
  used for pre- and post-processing, courses and smaller projects.
- Further information on [https://www.pdc.kth.se/](https://www.pdc.kth.se/).

### Teaching style

- There will be many exercises. You can choose between C, Fortran and Python.
- Don't hesitate to discuss with your neighbours or instructors.
- We will use red and green sticky notes as a signaling system 
  (*a la* The Carpentries and CodeRefinery):
   - Red: I need help or would like to discuss something
   - Green: I'm done with this exercise
- We follow The Carpentries Code of Conduct: 
  - [https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)
