### About PDC

- Founded in 1990 to provide HPC computing and storage resources,
  together with advanced system and application support, to Swedish
  academic researchers.  
- Main HPC system at PDC is 
  [Beskow](https://www.pdc.kth.se/hpc-services/computing-systems), 
  a Cray XC40 with a peak performance of nearly 2.5 petaflops
- We also have a smaller heterogeneous cluster called 
  [Tegner](https://www.pdc.kth.se/hpc-services/computing-systems/tegner-1.737437)
  used for pre- and post-processing, courses and smaller projects.
- Further information on [https://www.pdc.kth.se/](https://www.pdc.kth.se/).
- Presentation of instructors.

### Teaching style

- There will be many exercises. You can choose between C, Fortran and Python.
- Don't hesitate to discuss with your neighbours or instructors.
- We will use red and green sticky notes as a signaling system 
  (*a la* The Carpentries and CodeRefinery):
   - Red: I need help or would like to discuss something
   - Green: I'm done with this exercise
- We follow The Carpentries Code of Conduct: 
  - [https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)
